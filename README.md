# Control Freak

## Helping Improve Combat Awareness for Tanks & Raid Leaders

Control Freak gives you granular control over the Combat Log events that actually matter.

Unlike lightweight announcers that spam chat indiscriminately, Control Freak allows you to set distinct rules for You, your Party, and Outsiders. You decide what gets announced based on the source and the target—whether it is an Elite, a Boss, or everything in between.

## Key Features

* Smart Taunt Tracking (Single & AoE): Know exactly who taunted what. Supports all class taunts, including Warrior shouts, Druid roars, and even Engineering Target Dummies.

* Resist & Immune Detection: The only thing worse than a taunt is a failed taunt. Control Freak specifically tracks when critical spells are resisted or immune, playing a distinct failure sound so you can react instantly.

* Audio Alerts: Optional sound cues for Success, Failure, and AoE events. Know your taunt failed without ever looking at your chat window.

* Context Aware: Automatically switches settings based on your environment. Want detailed logs in Raids but silence in Battlegrounds? The addon automatically detects if you are Solo, in a Dungeon, Raid, Battleground, or Arena.

* The "Bad Pet" Monitor: Automatically identify when a pet taunts and instantly whisper the owner with a link to the spell so they can disable it. Configurable to limit frequency (e.g., once per boss) to avoid spamming your group.

* Tracks "Annoyances" like Mage Frost Novas or Warlock Fears that scatter mobs.
